# Torrent Dashboard Testing Guide

Automated checks are the release gate; this document records the manual verification that still depends on a browser, qBitTorrent instance, operating system, or update/restart behavior.

## Automated baseline

Run before and after a development increment:

```bash
python release_tools/validate_source.py
python release_tools/validate_ui_strings.py
node --check static/app.js
node --check static/settings.js
```

For a release candidate also verify generated documentation:

```bash
python release_tools/generate_release_notes.py --version X.Y.Z --check
```

The Python suite uses only the standard library and currently covers extracted domain behavior, configuration transactions, and source/architecture contracts.

## Manual smoke-test matrix

Only run tests that are relevant and safe in your environment. Never commit real credentials or private infrastructure details while documenting results.

### Startup and setup

- Fresh installation opens the first-run wizard.
- Setup completes with a reachable qBitTorrent instance.
- A failed client connection does not save partial setup state.
- Restarting after setup returns to the dashboard rather than the wizard.

### Authentication and roles

- Administrator login succeeds and administrative Settings/actions are available.
- Standard User login can view permitted dashboard/account surfaces and cannot perform administrator-only mutations.
- Logout invalidates the current session.
- Trusted-network behavior matches the configured access mode.

### Dashboard live state

- Dashboard refreshes without visibly reloading the page.
- Download/upload metrics and torrent counts reflect qBitTorrent state.
- Empty-state copy matches the real reason no rows are visible.
- Connection failures use the error banner and recover when connectivity returns.
- Search, category, tag, tracker, and status filters remain stable while polling.

### Torrent actions

- Start/resume, pause/stop, recheck, delete, force start, and location actions behave as expected for an administrator.
- Bulk actions operate only on selected torrents.
- Destructive actions require the expected confirmation.
- Standard Users cannot invoke administrator-only torrent mutations.

### Torrent details

- The docked torrent-details bar is always present on desktop/tablet and starts collapsed with no selection.
- Clicking the disclosure bar expands/collapses the inspector without clearing the selected torrent.
- Selecting a torrent automatically expands the inspector and updates the selected-torrent context.
- Expanding with no torrent selected shows the empty detail state without errors.
- Torrent list and detail body scroll independently when needed.
- General, Trackers, Peers, HTTP Sources, and Content tabs render without errors.
- Mobile keeps the persistent collapsed bar and uses the bottom-sheet presentation when expanded.

### Add Torrent

- Magnet/URL submission follows the normal qBitTorrent add path.
- `.torrent` upload follows the normal upload path.
- Metadata preview remains read-only and does not alter the source submitted to qBitTorrent.
- Metadata timeout/cancel paths leave the dialog usable.
- Save-as-`.torrent` is available only when metadata export is actually available.

### Settings

- General, Access, Clients, Updates, and Notifications use the shared **Settings saved** confirmation.
- User and Integration CRUD use scoped success/error language.
- Secret masks do not expose configured credentials back to the browser.
- Concurrent unrelated configuration changes do not overwrite one another.

### Updates and recovery

Use only a test installation or an environment where restart/rollback is acceptable.

- Check for updates discovers the intended public repository release.
- Patch notes show the current and previous release entries.
- Package SHA-256 values populate from authoritative release metadata.
- Downloaded update ZIP is verified before staging.
- Successful update restarts into the expected version.
- Runtime `config.json` and `data/` survive the update.
- A deliberately invalid test build rolls back rather than leaving the installation unusable.

### Responsive interface

At minimum check one desktop width and one mobile width after meaningful UI changes.

Desktop/tablet:

- Text remains legible at 100% browser zoom.
- Torrent workspace does not consume the entire page when few/no torrents are present.
- Torrent list plus open detail inspector fit in the initial viewport by default.
- No controls overlap at common desktop widths.

Mobile:

- Navigation remains reachable.
- Tables/cards do not introduce unusable horizontal overflow.
- Torrent detail bar remains reachable, expands as a bottom sheet, and collapses again with a full-width touch target.
- Dialogs remain operable with the on-screen keyboard present.

## Recording gaps

If a regression cannot reasonably be automated yet, record the missing coverage in `development/current.json` or the next release metadata and add it to this matrix if it is a recurring verification need.

Do not use this file as a test-results log; it is a stable testing contract for upstream and forks.

### Desktop torrent inspector

- With no torrent selected, verify the compact Torrent details bar remains visible below the torrent list without consuming the expanded workspace height.
- With a torrent selected at normal desktop zoom, verify the inspector expands automatically and the torrent list and inspector both remain visible without scrolling the overall page.
- Collapse the inspector and verify the selected row remains selected; expand it again and verify the same torrent details return.
- Verify the torrent inspector reaches the bottom of the visible dashboard content and is visually separated from the torrent list as its own bordered panel.
- Verify General, Trackers, Peers, HTTP Sources, and Content have a useful vertical viewport and scroll internally when needed.
- Resize the browser and verify the dock recalculates without overlapping the viewport; mobile continues to use the bottom-sheet presentation.


### Bottom-anchored torrent dock

- Verify Dashboard / Live torrent activity is visible on Dashboard while top-right controls remain available.
- With details collapsed, verify the disclosure bar sits at the bottom of the visible dashboard workspace.
- Expand details and verify the inspector grows upward from the same anchor while the torrent list scrolls above it.
- Resize desktop/tablet and verify both states remain bottom-aligned without overlaying torrent rows.
- Verify mobile retains the persistent collapsed bar above mobile navigation and expands into the sheet.


### Update-check intent and empty detail disclosure

- Open Settings → Updates and verify no GitHub update request is initiated solely by entering the page; cached/local release history may render immediately.
- Press Check for updates and verify the normal GitHub update lookup occurs and refreshes update/release-integrity information.
- With no torrent selected, verify the collapsed Torrent details bar contains no “No torrent selected” helper text.
- Select a torrent and verify the selected torrent name may appear in the disclosure context and the inspector expands normally.


### Server-selection defaults

- With exactly one enabled qBitTorrent client, verify that client is selected automatically and All servers is not offered in the server selector.
- With one enabled client, verify Add Torrent and other client-specific actions are immediately available without first changing the server selector.
- With two or more enabled clients, verify All servers is available as an aggregation choice.
- With multiple clients, select a specific client, reload the dashboard, and verify the valid previous selection is restored.
- Disable or remove the remembered client and verify the dashboard falls back to All servers when multiple clients remain, or automatically selects the sole remaining enabled client.


### Product language and capitalization

- Verify setup, sign-in, Dashboard, Settings, Add torrent, account, and client-settings surfaces after a copy-system change.
- Confirm named destinations retain their intended label casing while headings, labels, actions, statuses, errors, and explanatory copy use natural sentence case.
- Confirm qBitTorrent, Torrent Dashboard, GitHub, API, Web API, HTTP, IP, URL, SHA-256, and `.torrent` keep their established capitalization.
- Confirm authored copy does not visibly change after JavaScript initializes or after dynamically generated controls are inserted.
- Verify access controls say **Allowed IP addresses** rather than whitelist language and client-management actions use **client** where that is the user-facing concept.
- Verify validation and toast messages contain no camelCase tokens, internal field names, or mechanically recased technical terms.


### Add Torrent source modes and file selection

- Open Add Torrent and verify **Magnet link** and **.torrent file** are separate source tabs; switching tabs never causes the inactive source to be submitted.
- In Magnet link mode, paste one magnet URI and verify metadata loads without adding the torrent. Once ready, verify the Content panel shows selectable folders/files.
- Select and clear a folder and verify all descendant files follow it. Create a mixed selection and verify the parent folder and Select all controls show an indeterminate state.
- Change an included file between Normal, High, and Maximum priority, add the torrent, and verify qBitTorrent receives the corresponding file priorities. Unchecked files must arrive as Do not download.
- In .torrent file mode, click the drop area and verify the platform file picker opens. Repeat by dragging a `.torrent` file onto the drop area and verify the selected filename is shown and metadata is parsed.
- Add a parsed `.torrent` with at least one excluded file and verify the torrent is added through qBitTorrent's cached metadata with the selected files honored.
- Force metadata parsing to fail or use an older qBitTorrent build and verify a local `.torrent` can still fall back to direct upload, without selectable file priorities.
- After magnet metadata is ready, use **Save .torrent file** and verify a non-empty `.torrent` downloads. Repeat with a source whose torrent already exists in qBitTorrent and verify export fallback succeeds.
- In .torrent file mode, use **Save .torrent file** and verify the originally selected local file is downloaded without requiring qBitTorrent metadata cache availability.

### Add Torrent hierarchy and detail-selection reconciliation

- Load a multi-folder torrent in Add Torrent and verify every folder/file checkbox remains vertically aligned in the same selection column.
- Verify folder rows use the locally embedded Material disclosure icon and file rows reserve an equal-width spacer. A child file label must begin to the right of its parent folder label; deeper descendants should continue stepping right by hierarchy depth.
- Verify the Name header is left-aligned at the beginning of the name column, Size and Priority remain aligned, folder rows do not show descendant file counts, and the preview summary appears without a redundant Content heading.
- Select a torrent row and verify Torrent details expands for it. The disclosure bar should identify the selected torrent, and the expanded panel should proceed directly to the detail tabs without repeating the torrent title/hash in a second header.
- Click the same torrent row again and verify the selected-row treatment clears and Torrent details returns to the empty collapsed disclosure.
- Select one torrent and then a different torrent; verify details switch directly to the second torrent rather than clearing first.
- With a torrent selected in Torrent details, remove that torrent (or remove it directly in qBitTorrent) and verify the next status refresh clears the stale detail context and collapses the dock. Removing another torrent must not clear the current detail selection.


### Configurable torrent columns

- On a browser with no saved column preference, verify Seeds, Peers, Category, and Tags are visible by default alongside Name, Progress, Status, Download, Upload, ETA, and Ratio.
- Verify Settings → General does not contain a duplicate torrent-column organizer.
- Drag several visible column headers left and right and verify the table follows the new order immediately, after the next one-second refresh, and after a full browser reload.
- Drag the right edge of Name, Progress, Status, Category, and Tags to narrower and wider sizes. Hold at least one resize gesture open for several seconds across multiple one-second refreshes and verify the live width never snaps back or jumps because torrent rows rerendered under the pointer. Release the pointer and verify the latest torrent state renders once without changing the chosen width. Verify Name can shrink to its compact minimum, each column stops at its documented readable minimum, and the committed width persists after reload.
- Hide a resized optional column from the Columns menu, show it again, and verify its saved width returns.
- Verify the resize edge is easy to acquire without pixel-perfect positioning. Start resizing near the divider and verify header reordering cannot begin until the resize gesture is released; then drag from the body of the same header and verify normal reordering still works and does not discard its saved width.
- Verify every configurable data-column header label is centered within its column and remains visually centered before, during, and after resizing. The resize gutter should not make labels appear shifted left, and right-aligned data cells such as Seeds/Peers must still use centered headers.
- Verify the resize gutter never extends into the next header. In particular, move the pointer across the boundary between the last visible data column and the far-right actions column; the actions column must never show resize behavior or change width.
- With Name at its default/automatic width, verify long torrent names are not truncated by the old fixed 470/620 px cap. Resize Name narrower and confirm ellipsis appears only when the actual cell becomes too narrow; widen it again and confirm additional text becomes visible.
- Right-click the torrent header bar and verify the Columns menu lists every data column, including Name, and can show/hide all data columns. Hide Name and verify the remaining torrent columns continue to render and operate normally.
- Hide and restore several columns from the header menu and verify the table updates immediately without changing qBitTorrent state.
- Use Reset columns from the header menu and verify the default order/visibility is restored, Category remains visible, and custom widths are cleared.
- Verify Size, Tracker, and Added can be enabled; Seeds displays connected seeds with the total in parentheses when qBitTorrent supplies a total, and Peers follows the same convention.
- Verify the selection checkbox and row-actions control remain fixed at the outer edges and do not expose resize handles. The row-actions column must stay at its fixed width and pinned to the right edge while data columns resize or the table scrolls horizontally.
- Verify a browser with an existing customized v0.5.84-v0.5.86 layout keeps its custom order and visibility; missing width data should simply use automatic sizing until the user resizes a column.
